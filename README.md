## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a backend engineer specializing in building high-performance APIs and web services using C# and ASP.NET Core. This repository is a collection of projects, code samples, and ideas that reflect my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and scalable backend solutions.

My primary focus is on creating RESTful APIs that are secure, fast, and easy to maintain. I use ASP.NET Core to build robust application backends, leveraging its powerful middleware pipeline, dependency injection, and modular architecture to ensure flexibility and performance. From handling routing and request validation to implementing custom middleware and error handling, I enjoy working with the full range of tools the framework offers.

C# is my language of choice due to its strong typing, performance capabilities, and powerful ecosystem. I apply object-oriented and SOLID principles to structure applications that are easy to scale and extend. Whether itâ€™s creating asynchronous services, managing database access with Entity Framework Core, or integrating with external systems, I strive to write code that is maintainable, testable, and reliable.

PostgreSQL and SQL Server are typically part of my stack for data persistence, and I focus on designing normalized schemas, optimizing queries, and managing migrations with tools like EF Core or FluentMigrator. I also incorporate logging, monitoring, and unit testing as part of a well-rounded development process.

This repository includes everything from small, isolated API components to complete service layers that demonstrate best practices in ASP.NET Core development. If youâ€™re interested in backend engineering, system design, or API development, feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, and continuous learning.
